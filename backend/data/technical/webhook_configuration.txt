Webhook Configuration and Event Handling

Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time notifications when events occur in your account, eliminating the need for constant polling. To set up webhooks, go to Settings > Developers > Webhooks and click "Add Webhook Endpoint." Enter your HTTPS endpoint URL (must use SSL/TLS) and select which events you want to receive: user.created, user.updated, task.completed, payment.succeeded, export.ready, etc. You can subscribe to all events using the wildcard "*" or select specific events for targeted integrations.

Each webhook request includes a JSON payload with event details and is signed with an HMAC-SHA256 signature in the X-Webhook-Signature header for verification. Verify signatures by computing HMAC-SHA256 of the request body using your webhook signing secret (displayed when creating the endpoint) and comparing it to the header value. Your endpoint must respond with a 200 status code within 5 seconds to acknowledge receipt – if we don't receive a timely response, we'll retry the webhook up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour). Failed deliveries are logged in the webhook dashboard where you can manually retry them. Webhook payloads include an "event_id" for idempotency – use this to detect and ignore duplicate deliveries. For high-volume events, consider implementing a queue on your end to process webhooks asynchronously. Test your webhook integration using the "Send Test Event" button in the webhook settings, or use a tool like webhook.site to inspect payloads during development. For security, implement IP whitelisting to accept requests only from our webhook sender IPs (available in the documentation), and always verify signatures before processing events.
