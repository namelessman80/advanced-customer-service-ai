API Setup and Authentication Guide

Getting started with our API is straightforward and takes just a few minutes. First, log into your account and navigate to Settings > Developers > API Keys. Click "Create New API Key" and provide a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Integration" or "Dev Environment"). For security, API keys are only displayed once upon creation, so copy it immediately and store it securely using a secrets management system like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or environment variables – never commit API keys to version control.

To authenticate API requests, include your key in the Authorization header using the Bearer token format: "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY". Our API uses RESTful conventions with base URL https://api.yourservice.com/v2/. All requests must use HTTPS, and HTTP requests will be rejected. Rate limits vary by plan: Basic (1,000 requests/day), Premium (10,000 requests/day), Enterprise (unlimited). Include these recommended headers in all requests: "Content-Type: application/json" and "Accept: application/json". Response codes follow standard HTTP conventions: 2xx for success, 4xx for client errors (check your request format), 5xx for server errors (retry with exponential backoff). We recommend using our official SDK libraries available for Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP, which handle authentication, retries, and error handling automatically. View complete API documentation with interactive examples at https://docs.yourservice.com/api. For sandbox testing, use the test API endpoint https://sandbox-api.yourservice.com/v2/ with your regular API key – sandbox data is automatically reset every 24 hours.
