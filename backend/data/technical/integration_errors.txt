Fixing API Integration Errors

API integration errors typically fall into three categories: authentication failures, rate limiting issues, and data format problems. For authentication errors (401 Unauthorized), verify that your API key is correctly formatted and hasn't expired. API keys can be regenerated in your account settings under Developers > API Keys. Ensure you're including the API key in the Authorization header as "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" and that your key has the necessary permissions for the operations you're attempting.

Rate limit errors (429 Too Many Requests) occur when you exceed your plan's API request quota. Check your current usage in the API dashboard, and consider upgrading your plan if you consistently hit limits. Implement exponential backoff in your code to automatically retry failed requests after brief delays. For data validation errors (400 Bad Request or 422 Unprocessable Entity), carefully review the error message returned in the response body – it will specify which fields are invalid or missing. Common issues include missing required parameters, incorrect data types (sending strings instead of integers), or malformed JSON payloads. Use our API documentation's example requests as templates, and consider testing your integration in a sandbox environment before deploying to production. Timeout errors (504 Gateway Timeout) may indicate that your requests are too complex or processing large datasets – try breaking batch operations into smaller chunks of 100 records or fewer per request.
