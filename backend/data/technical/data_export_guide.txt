Complete Data Export Guide

Our platform provides multiple methods for exporting your data to ensure you maintain full control and ownership. The easiest method is through the web interface: navigate to Settings > Data > Export, select your desired data types (users, tasks, files, activity logs), choose your preferred format (CSV, JSON, or Excel), and specify a date range. Click "Start Export" and you'll receive an email notification when your export is ready for download, typically within 15 minutes for standard accounts.

For automated or scheduled exports, use the API export endpoint: POST /api/v2/exports with parameters {"data_types": ["users", "tasks"], "format": "json", "date_from": "2024-01-01"}. Large exports (over 10,000 records) are processed asynchronously – the API returns a job_id that you can use to check status via GET /api/v2/exports/{job_id} and download the file once status shows "completed". Enterprise customers can schedule automatic daily or weekly exports to be delivered via email or uploaded directly to your S3 bucket or SFTP server. Configure scheduled exports in Settings > Data > Scheduled Exports. All exports are encrypted at rest and in transit, and download links expire after 48 hours for security. For database-level exports with complete schema and relationships, Enterprise customers can request a full PostgreSQL dump by contacting support – these are provided as encrypted .sql files and typically contain up to 30 days of historical data. Exported files retain all metadata, timestamps, and relationships to ensure complete data portability. If you need assistance with data migration to another platform, our customer success team can provide export consultation and file format customization.
