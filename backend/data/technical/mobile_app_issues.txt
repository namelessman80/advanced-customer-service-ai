Mobile App Troubleshooting Guide

Mobile app problems often require different solutions than web-based issues. If the app crashes on startup or freezes frequently, first ensure you're running the latest version from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android). Outdated versions may have known bugs that have been fixed in recent updates. If updating doesn't help, try force-closing the app completely and restarting it. On iOS, swipe up from the bottom and swipe the app away; on Android, go to Settings > Apps > [App Name] > Force Stop.

For sync issues where data isn't appearing or seems outdated, check that you have a stable internet connection and that background app refresh is enabled in your device settings. Pull down on the main screen to manually trigger a sync. If certain features aren't working, verify that you've granted the necessary permissions – the app requires camera access for document scanning, location access for check-in features, and notification permissions for alerts. Clear the app cache by going to Settings > Storage > Clear Cache (Android) or reinstalling the app (iOS). Storage space issues can cause unexpected behavior, so ensure your device has at least 500MB of free space. For login problems specific to mobile, make sure you're not using an outdated saved password and that your device's date and time are set correctly (automatic setting recommended). If problems persist after trying these steps, uninstall and reinstall the app, which will reset all local data and settings.
