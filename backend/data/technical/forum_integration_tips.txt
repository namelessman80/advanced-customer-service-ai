Community Forum: Integration Tips and Best Practices

Zapier Integration Success Stories:
Many users have shared their Zapier workflows for automating tasks. Popular integrations include: auto-creating tasks from Gmail emails using filters, syncing new Google Calendar events to task due dates, posting task completions to Slack channels, and creating new users from Typeform submissions. Pro tip from @ProductivityGuru: use Zapier's "Paths" feature to route different email subjects to different project workspaces. The most upvoted workflow template connects HubSpot deals to projects, automatically creating a project when a deal reaches "Closed Won" stage with all custom fields mapped.

Custom API Integration Patterns:
Senior developer @CodeMaster42 shared a comprehensive guide on building robust API integrations: always implement retry logic with exponential backoff, use webhook events instead of polling for real-time updates, batch API calls to stay under rate limits, cache frequently accessed data locally with TTL, and implement proper error handling for all possible response codes. For bulk operations, use the batch endpoints (/api/v2/batch/tasks) which accept arrays of operations and return partial success results. Another popular tip: implement idempotency keys in your requests to safely retry operations without creating duplicates. Several developers shared open-source integration libraries for Python, Node.js, and Go. (Thread: 290+ upvotes, code examples on GitHub)

SSO and SAML Configuration:
Enterprise users share SSO setup experiences with various identity providers. For Okta: use the pre-built SAML app from Okta's catalog, map attributes correctly (email → email, firstName → first_name), and test with a single user before enabling for the entire organization. For Azure AD: configure the identifier as https://yourcompany.yourservice.com/saml and reply URL as https://yourcompany.yourservice.com/saml/callback. Common gotcha: ensure your IdP is sending email addresses in lowercase as our system is case-sensitive on email matching. @ITDirector posted a checklist for SSO deployments that's been bookmarked 500+ times.

Mobile SDK Integration for Custom Apps:
Developers building custom mobile apps share tips for integrating our mobile SDK: initialize the SDK in your app's didFinishLaunching (iOS) or Application.onCreate (Android), implement proper background sync to handle network interruptions, use the SDK's built-in offline mode for better UX, and leverage the real-time sync observers to update UI reactively. For React Native, use the community-maintained wrapper package (@yourservice/react-native-sdk). Performance tip: implement pagination when loading large lists – the SDK supports cursor-based pagination for efficient data loading. Several complete implementation examples are available in the forum's "Code Samples" category. (Thread: 160+ upvotes, linked GitHub repositories)
