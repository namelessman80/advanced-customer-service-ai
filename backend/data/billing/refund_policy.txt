Refund and Cancellation Policy

We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for all new subscriptions. If you are not satisfied with our service within the first 30 days of your initial subscription, contact our support team to request a full refund. This guarantee applies only to your first billing cycle and does not extend to renewals or plan upgrades. Refunds are processed within 5-7 business days and will be returned to the original payment method.

For cancellations after the 30-day period, you may cancel your subscription at any time, but refunds will not be provided for the current billing period. Monthly subscriptions will remain active until the end of the current billing month, and annual subscriptions will remain active until the end of the annual term. Pro-rated refunds are not available except in cases of service outages exceeding our published SLA commitments. To cancel your subscription, navigate to the billing settings in your account dashboard and select "Cancel Subscription," or contact our support team for assistance. Cancelled accounts will be downgraded to a free read-only tier for 90 days, allowing you to export your data before permanent deletion.
