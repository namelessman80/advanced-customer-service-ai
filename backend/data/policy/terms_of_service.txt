Terms of Service

Welcome to our service. By accessing or using our platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. These terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you (either as an individual or on behalf of an entity) and our company. If you do not agree to all of the terms, you may not access or use the service.

Account Registration and Responsibilities: You must provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized access or security breach. You may not share your account with others, create multiple accounts, or use the service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must be at least 18 years old or have parental consent to use this service.

Service Usage and Restrictions: Our service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the service for your internal business or personal purposes. You agree not to modify, reverse engineer, or create derivative works from our service; use the service to transmit malware, spam, or malicious code; attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems or other users' accounts; scrape, crawl, or index the service using automated means beyond what we provide through our API; or violate any applicable laws or regulations.

Intellectual Property: All content, features, and functionality of the service, including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, icons, images, and software, are the exclusive property of our company and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You retain ownership of any content you submit to the service, but you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute your content solely for the purpose of providing and improving the service.

Termination: We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time, with or without notice, for violation of these terms or any other reason. Upon termination, your right to access and use the service immediately ceases. You may terminate your account at any time by following the cancellation process in your account settings. Sections of these terms that by their nature should survive termination will remain in effect, including intellectual property provisions, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution provisions.

Limitation of Liability and Warranty Disclaimer: TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, WHETHER ARISING FROM CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Modifications to Terms: We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. We will provide notice of material changes by email or through the service at least 30 days before the effective date. Your continued use of the service after the effective date constitutes your acceptance of the modified terms. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you must stop using the service and may cancel your account for a pro-rated refund if the changes materially diminish your rights.

Governing Law and Dispute Resolution: These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any dispute arising from these terms or your use of the service shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if they qualify. You waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.
