Privacy Policy

Last Updated: November 1, 2024. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your personal information when you use our service. We are committed to transparency and compliance with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.

Information We Collect: We collect several types of information from and about you: (1) Account Information - email address, name, company name, phone number, billing address, and payment method details. (2) Usage Information - pages visited, features used, time spent on the service, search queries, IP address, device information, browser type, and operating system. (3) Content Data - any information, files, or content you upload, create, or transmit through the service, including task descriptions, comments, file attachments, and custom field data. (4) Communication Data - support tickets, feedback, survey responses, and any other messages you send to us. (5) Cookie and Tracking Data - we use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information about your browsing behavior and preferences.

How We Use Your Information: We use collected information to: provide, maintain, and improve the service; process transactions and send billing notifications; respond to your requests and provide customer support; send administrative information, product updates, and security alerts; personalize your experience and recommend features; analyze usage patterns to enhance performance and functionality; detect, prevent, and address technical issues, fraud, and security threats; comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms of service; send marketing communications (you can opt out at any time). We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

Information Sharing and Disclosure: We may share your information with: (1) Service Providers - third-party vendors who help us operate the service, such as cloud hosting providers (AWS, Google Cloud), payment processors (Stripe), email service providers (SendGrid), and analytics tools (Google Analytics). These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the purposes we specify. (2) Business Transfers - if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. (3) Legal Requirements - when required by law, subpoena, court order, or governmental request, or when we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, your safety, or the safety of others. (4) With Your Consent - we may share your information with other third parties when you explicitly authorize us to do so.

Data Security: We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information, including encryption in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest (AES-256), regular security audits, access controls limiting data access to authorized personnel only, secure authentication with multi-factor authentication options, and regular backups. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials.

Your Privacy Rights and Choices: Depending on your location, you may have the following rights: (1) Access - request a copy of the personal information we hold about you. (2) Rectification - request correction of inaccurate or incomplete information. (3) Deletion - request deletion of your personal information (subject to legal obligations requiring retention). (4) Data Portability - receive your data in a structured, machine-readable format. (5) Objection - object to our processing of your information for certain purposes. (6) Opt-Out - unsubscribe from marketing emails or disable cookies in your browser settings. To exercise these rights, contact us at privacy@yourservice.com. We will respond to your request within 30 days.

Data Retention: We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the service. After account deletion, we retain certain information for legitimate business purposes and legal obligations: backup copies for 90 days, financial records for 7 years (tax and accounting requirements), and aggregated anonymous analytics data indefinitely. You can request earlier deletion by contacting support, subject to legal retention requirements.

International Data Transfers: Our service is operated in the United States, and your information may be transferred to and processed in countries outside your country of residence. We comply with applicable data protection laws for international transfers, including using Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers from the EU/EEA and other approved mechanisms.

Children's Privacy: Our service is not intended for children under 13 years of age (or 16 in the EU). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we discover that we have collected information from a child, we will delete it immediately. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, contact us at privacy@yourservice.com.

Changes to Privacy Policy: We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of material changes by email or prominent notice in the service at least 30 days before the effective date. Your continued use of the service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. We encourage you to review this policy regularly to stay informed about how we protect your information.
