GDPR Data Subject Rights and Procedures

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, and Switzerland, we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and equivalent data protection laws. This document outlines your rights as a data subject and the procedures for exercising those rights.

Right to Access (Article 15): You have the right to obtain confirmation of whether we process your personal data and, if so, receive a copy of that data along with information about how it's being processed. To request access, submit a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) through your account settings under Privacy > My Data Rights, or email gdpr@yourservice.com with the subject line "GDPR Access Request." We will provide the requested information within 30 days, extended up to 90 days for complex requests. The first copy is provided free of charge; additional copies may incur a reasonable administrative fee.

Right to Rectification (Article 16): You have the right to have inaccurate personal data corrected and incomplete data completed. You can update most information directly in your account settings. For data you cannot modify yourself, submit a rectification request to gdpr@yourservice.com detailing the incorrect information and the corrections needed. We will respond within 30 days and notify any third parties to whom we've disclosed the data about the rectification.

Right to Erasure / Right to Be Forgotten (Article 17): You have the right to have your personal data deleted when: (1) the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, (2) you withdraw consent and there's no other legal basis for processing, (3) you object to processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds, (4) the data was unlawfully processed, or (5) erasure is required for compliance with legal obligations. To request erasure, navigate to Settings > Privacy > Delete Account, or email gdpr@yourservice.com. We will delete your data within 30 days, except where retention is required by law (e.g., financial records for tax purposes, data needed for legal claims, or public interest purposes). You will receive confirmation when deletion is complete.

Right to Restriction of Processing (Article 18): You have the right to restrict how we process your data in certain circumstances: while we verify accuracy of disputed data, when processing is unlawful but you prefer restriction over erasure, when we no longer need the data but you need it for legal claims, or while we verify legitimate grounds following your objection to processing. To request restriction, email gdpr@yourservice.com explaining which data and the reason for restriction. Restricted data will be stored but not processed further without your consent, except for legal claims or to protect others' rights.

Right to Data Portability (Article 20): You have the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format (JSON or CSV) and transmit it to another controller. This applies to data you provided to us based on consent or contract performance, and where processing is automated. Request data portability through Settings > Privacy > Export My Data, or email gdpr@yourservice.com. We will provide the export within 30 days. Where technically feasible and upon request, we can transmit your data directly to another controller.

Right to Object (Article 21): You have the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests, direct marketing, or scientific/historical research. To object, email gdpr@yourservice.com specifying the processing activity and your grounds for objection. For direct marketing, you can opt out anytime by clicking unsubscribe in emails or adjusting preferences in your account. We will cease processing unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or processing is necessary for legal claims.

Rights Related to Automated Decision-Making (Article 22): You have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that produce legal effects or significantly affect you. We do not engage in fully automated decision-making with legal or similarly significant effects. If this changes, we will notify you and provide information about the logic involved, significance, and consequences, as well as the opportunity to request human intervention.

Right to Withdraw Consent (Article 7): Where processing is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw it at any time. Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before withdrawal. To withdraw consent, adjust your preferences in Settings > Privacy > Consent Management, or email gdpr@yourservice.com. We will stop the relevant processing activities immediately upon receipt of withdrawal.

Right to Lodge a Complaint: If you believe we've violated your rights under GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. For a list of EU data protection authorities, visit https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en. While we encourage you to contact us first to resolve concerns, you may file a complaint at any time. Our lead supervisory authority for GDPR matters is the Irish Data Protection Commission.

Exercising Your Rights: All requests should include: (1) your full name and email address associated with your account, (2) specific right(s) you wish to exercise, (3) description of the data or processing in question, and (4) copy of valid identification to verify your identity (required for security). We respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days, with possible extension to 90 days for complex requests. Extensions will be communicated with explanation. There is no fee for exercising your rights, except where requests are manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive, in which case we may charge a reasonable fee or refuse the request. Contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@yourservice.com or mail to: Data Protection Officer, 123 Main Street, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA.
