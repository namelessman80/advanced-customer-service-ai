Cookie Policy

Last Updated: November 1, 2024. This Cookie Policy explains how we use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website and service, and how you can control them.

What Are Cookies: Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, smartphone, or tablet) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work efficiently, remember your preferences, and provide information to website owners. Cookies may be set by the website you're visiting ("first-party cookies") or by third parties such as analytics providers or advertisers ("third-party cookies").

Types of Cookies We Use: (1) Strictly Necessary Cookies - essential for operating the website and service. These cookies enable core functionality such as security, authentication, session management, and basic navigation. You cannot opt out of strictly necessary cookies as they're required for the service to function. Examples: session_id (maintains your login session), csrf_token (prevents cross-site request forgery attacks), auth_token (authenticates your API requests). Duration: session or 30 days. (2) Functional Cookies - enhance your experience by remembering your preferences and settings. These cookies are not essential but provide a better user experience. Examples: language_preference (stores your language selection), theme_mode (remembers dark/light mode choice), sidebar_collapsed (saves UI layout preferences), timezone (sets your time zone for date displays). Duration: 12 months. You can disable these through cookie preferences, but some features may not work as smoothly. (3) Performance and Analytics Cookies - collect anonymous information about how visitors use the service, helping us understand which features are popular, identify technical issues, and improve performance. Examples: _ga (Google Analytics, tracks usage patterns), _gid (Google Analytics, session tracking), performance_metrics (measures page load times), error_tracking (captures JavaScript errors for debugging). Duration: 13-24 months. These cookies do not identify you personally as all data is aggregated and anonymized. (4) Marketing and Advertising Cookies - track your browsing behavior to deliver targeted advertisements and measure campaign effectiveness. Examples: _fbp (Facebook Pixel, tracks conversions), _gcl (Google Ads, attribution tracking), utm_source (campaign source tracking). Duration: 90 days. These cookies may be set by third-party advertising networks and are only used if you consent to marketing cookies.

Similar Technologies: In addition to cookies, we use other tracking technologies: Local Storage - stores data locally in your browser for faster performance and offline functionality. Used for caching UI preferences and temporary data. Session Storage - stores temporary session data that's cleared when you close your browser. Used for form state and navigation history. Web Beacons (Pixels) - tiny invisible images embedded in emails and webpages that notify us when content is viewed. Used in email campaigns to track open rates and engagement. Device Fingerprinting - collects information about your device configuration (browser version, screen resolution, installed plugins) to identify devices for security and fraud prevention. API Tokens - stored in your browser to maintain authenticated API sessions. These are essential for service functionality.

Cookie Management and Your Choices: You have several options for controlling cookies: Browser Cookie Settings - most browsers allow you to refuse or delete cookies through settings menus. However, disabling strictly necessary cookies will prevent you from using the service. Browser instructions: Chrome (Settings > Privacy and Security > Cookies), Firefox (Settings > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data), Safari (Preferences > Privacy > Cookies), Edge (Settings > Privacy > Cookies and site permissions). Our Cookie Preference Center - access cookie settings through the website footer link "Cookie Settings" or in your account under Settings > Privacy > Cookie Preferences. Here you can enable/disable non-essential cookie categories: Functional Cookies (ON/OFF), Performance Cookies (ON/OFF), Marketing Cookies (ON/OFF). Changes are saved immediately and cookies are deleted within 24 hours. Global Privacy Control (GPC) - we honor GPC signals from browsers that automatically communicate opt-out preferences. Do Not Track (DNT) - while we support GPC, we don't respond to DNT signals as there's no universal standard for interpretation. Third-Party Opt-Outs - opt out of Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on (tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). Opt out of interest-based advertising through industry opt-out pages: NAI (networkadvertising.org/choices), DAA (optout.aboutads.info), EDAA for EU users (youronlinechoices.eu).

Cookie Consent for EU/EEA Users: In compliance with GDPR and ePrivacy Directive, we request your explicit consent before placing non-essential cookies. When you first visit our site, a cookie banner appears with options to: Accept All Cookies, Reject All (except strictly necessary), Customize Settings. Your choice is recorded and you can change preferences anytime through Cookie Settings. We do not place performance or marketing cookies until you consent, except where cookies are strictly necessary for service functionality. Cookie consent is stored in the cookie_consent cookie (12 months) and associated with your account if logged in.

Updates to Cookie Policy: We may update this Cookie Policy to reflect changes in our use of cookies or legal requirements. Material changes will be communicated through a notice on the website or via email 30 days before taking effect. The "Last Updated" date at the top indicates when the policy was last revised. Continued use of the service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
