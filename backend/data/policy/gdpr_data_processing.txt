GDPR Data Processing and Compliance Information

Legal Basis for Processing: Under GDPR Article 6, we process your personal data based on the following legal grounds: (1) Contractual Necessity (Article 6(1)(b)) - processing is necessary to fulfill our contract with you and provide the service you requested, including account management, service delivery, and billing. (2) Legitimate Interests (Article 6(1)(f)) - we process data based on our legitimate interests in operating, improving, and securing the service, preventing fraud, and ensuring system performance, provided these interests don't override your fundamental rights. (3) Legal Obligation (Article 6(1)(c)) - processing is required to comply with laws such as tax regulations, financial record-keeping, and responding to lawful requests from authorities. (4) Consent (Article 6(1)(a)) - for optional processing activities like marketing communications, non-essential cookies, and sharing data with third parties beyond what's necessary for service provision. You can withdraw consent at any time without affecting service functionality.

Data Processing Activities and Purposes: We engage in the following categories of data processing: Service Provision - processing account information, usage data, and content to deliver core platform functionality and features. Technical Operations - processing technical logs, error reports, and performance metrics to maintain system reliability, diagnose issues, and optimize performance. Customer Support - processing support tickets, communication history, and account activity to respond to your inquiries and resolve problems. Billing and Payments - processing payment information, transaction history, and invoices to charge for services and maintain financial records. Security and Fraud Prevention - processing access logs, authentication attempts, IP addresses, and behavioral patterns to detect and prevent unauthorized access, abuse, and security threats. Analytics and Improvement - processing aggregated usage statistics, feature adoption metrics, and user feedback to improve the service and develop new features. Marketing and Communications - processing contact information and communication preferences to send product updates, newsletters, and promotional materials (with consent). Research and Development - processing anonymized and aggregated data for statistical analysis, machine learning model training, and service innovation.

Data Retention Periods: We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law: Active Accounts - data retained for the duration of your subscription plus 90 days in read-only archive. Billing Records - 7 years from transaction date (required for tax and accounting regulations). Support Communications - 3 years from last interaction for quality assurance and dispute resolution. Marketing Data - until consent is withdrawn or you unsubscribe, after which we retain suppression lists to honor opt-out requests. Security Logs - 12 months for incident investigation and compliance monitoring. Aggregated Analytics - retained indefinitely in anonymized form with no ability to identify individuals. Legal Holds - data subject to litigation hold or legal proceedings retained until resolution. After retention periods expire, data is securely deleted using industry-standard methods including overwri

ting, cryptographic erasure, and physical destruction of storage media.

International Data Transfers and Safeguards: Our primary servers are located in the United States, and we use subprocessors located in various countries worldwide. Data transfers from the EEA to these countries are protected by appropriate safeguards as required by GDPR Chapter V: Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) - we use the European Commission's approved SCCs (Decision 2021/914) with all non-EEA data processors, ensuring equivalent protection to EU law. Adequacy Decisions - where possible, we transfer data to countries recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate protection (Article 45). Supplementary Measures - we implement additional technical and organizational measures beyond SCCs, including encryption, access controls, data minimization, and regular security assessments. Transfer Impact Assessments - we conduct risk assessments for transfers to evaluate local laws and practices that may affect data protection. A list of our subprocessors and their locations is available at yourservice.com/subprocessors and is updated quarterly. You may object to use of specific subprocessors by emailing dpo@yourservice.com within 30 days of notification.

Data Protection by Design and Default (Article 25): We implement data protection principles throughout our system design and operations: Pseudonymization and Encryption - personal data is encrypted both in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256). Internal database identifiers are pseudonymized where possible. Data Minimization - we collect only data necessary for specified purposes. Features are designed to operate with minimal data collection, and optional features requiring additional data are opt-in. Purpose Limitation - data collected for one purpose is not used for incompatible purposes without explicit consent or legal obligation. Access Controls - role-based access controls (RBAC) limit data access to personnel who need it for job functions. Multi-factor authentication is required for administrative access. Privacy Settings - default settings favor data protection, with users able to granularly control data collection, sharing, and communication preferences. Regular Assessments - we conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for high-risk processing activities and review them annually or when processing changes significantly.

Data Processor Agreements and Responsibilities: Where we act as a data processor for our Enterprise customers (who are data controllers), we provide GDPR-compliant data processing agreements including: Processing Instructions - we process personal data only on documented instructions from the controller unless required by law. Security Measures - we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures as specified in Article 32. Subprocessor Management - we notify controllers of subprocessor changes and obtain prior authorization or provide opt-out opportunity. Data Breach Notification - we notify controllers within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach affecting their data. Assistance with DSARs - we provide reasonable assistance to controllers in responding to data subject rights requests. Deletion or Return - upon contract termination, we delete or return all personal data as instructed by the controller. Audit Rights - we allow and contribute to audits and inspections conducted by the controller or authorized auditor. Enterprise customers acting as controllers are responsible for ensuring their own legal basis for processing, providing privacy notices to their users, and handling data subject rights requests for data they control.
